# fake-version-history
## Introduction
Python script for appending text to a word document in order to fake the version history. The purpose of this was to find a way to take pre-written text and paste it into a document such that you could fake the version history to where it could stand up to mild scrutiny. The idea behind this is that if you use an AI LLM to write an essay for you, if someone were to challenge you on the authenticity you would be able to show them the version history in the cloud version to "prove" you wrote the document.

As of right now, the entire script was written by ChatGPT with minor tweaks by me (paths, times, etc.). The purpose of this was to prove that someone could complete this task using ChatGPT alone and starting with a mild understanding of software coding, namely being able to set up an environment to run Python. Obviously, you can use ChatGPT to explain everything and teach you the process if you have no knowledge, but I already had the knowledge so I didn't need to do that.
